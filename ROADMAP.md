# Guildfinder Road-Map
Guildfinder manages to make itself seem a bigger and bigger project every single time I work on it, but breaking it down into smaller, easier chunks turns the mountain into a whole bunch of different mole-hills. 
## Planned Features
I've broken down my planned features by versioning, mainly to help myself stick to the versioning scheme.
### Version 0.0.1-0.0.9
- First Five Weapons (Sword and Shield, Hammer, Greatsword, Dual Blades, and Bow)
- Monster Part System (requires coding knowledge I am yet to have)
### Version 0.1.0-0.5.0
- Four more weapons (Lance, Gunlance and the Bowguns.)
- New Shield Mechanic: Knockback Threshold.
### Version 0.5.1-0.9.0
- Three More Weapons (TBA)
- Armor Skill system (relies on the Rune system being changed to support homebrew Runes, most likely.)
- Carving/Monster Material rules
### Version 1.0.0
- Ancestries (Wyverian, Troverian, Humans)
- Backgrounds
- Feats
- Rest of the Weapons
- Mounting
- Status damage.
### Onward
- Introdutory Adventure
- Refine All Systems
- Beg at the feet of Capcom to actually get permission to use the IP and become God of the New World.
- Pester the PF2e system devs for homebrew conditions.
